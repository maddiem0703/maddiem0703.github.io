    <h2>Research & Analysis: Female Writers Throughout History</h2>
    <p>I have written multiple analysis papers on works by women writers from the last couple centuries. Alongside the analysis, I researched the authors themselves to understand what may have inspired their ideas.</p>

    <h2>Professional Writing: Grant for Local Animal Shelter</h2>
    <p>I am currently working on writing my first mock grant. I'm doing so in my JYW course and have chosen the local nonprofit Joyful Pets to use as my inspiration.</p>

    <h2>Work Experiences: Kelly's Farm 2021-Present</h2>
    <p>I took this picture over the summer while I worked in one of the greenhouses. Most of my work experience has come from working at this farm for the past 4 summers and I've worked my way up to a management position, which gives me insight on how to run a small business and market yourself.</p>
