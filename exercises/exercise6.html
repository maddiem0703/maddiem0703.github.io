    <h2>More Information</h2>
    <p>I am a junior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My major is English and I am completing a <a href="https://www.umass.edu/english/professional-writing-and-technical-communication" target="_blank">Professional Writing and Technical Communication Certificate</a>. I have always used writing as my platform and I stand by the
        idea that words are powerful. By combining my personal interests and my studies, I have strengthened my
        communication skills, written and verbal, and expanded my writing skills to cover many genres, ranging from
        analytical to creative to technical. I have developed a passion for creating high-quality, engaging pieces that
        can effectively spread a message to any reader.</p>
    <p>My course work has covered a diverse array of subject matter and I have had wonderful opportunities to obtain
        many skills and reflect on my writing and communication styles. I am committed to creating purposeful writing
        and am eager to see where my skills can take me in my career. I am excited to contribute to the professional
        sphere and look forward to any opportunity that will come my way!</p>
